# Crypto Airdrop Bot

This repository contains a Python bot designed for crypto enthusiasts who hunt airdrops. The bot automates:
- **Email Account Creation:** Up to 15 permanent emails (via browser automation) and 5 temporary emails (using an API).
- **Twitter Account Creation:** Uses Selenium to create accounts with realistic details generated by Faker. It attempts SMS verification if necessary.
- **Referral Automation:** Processes provided referral links, fills out forms, and solves CAPTCHAs via 2Captcha integration.
- **Data Storage:** Saves account details in a JSON file for future use.

## Features
- **Modular Design:** Separated modules for email creation, Twitter account creation, and referral handling.
- **Human-like Behavior:** Includes delays and simulated mouse movements.
- **Docker Support:** Easily deploy using the provided Dockerfile.
- **Documentation:** Detailed instructions provided in this README.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NEWprofilecreator.git
   cd NEWprofilecreator

2.pip install -r requirements.txt

3.python main.py

4. docker build -t NEWprofilecreator .
docker run -it NEWprofilecreator




docker build -t crypto_airdrop_bot .
docker run -it crypto_airdrop_bot


#Notes
CAPTCHA Solving: Ensure you have a valid 2Captcha API key and adjust the integration in bot/utils.py.
SMS Verification: For Twitter, integrate your preferred third-party SMS service if needed.
Ethics & Compliance: Use this bot responsibly and be aware of platform terms of service.

## **Next Steps**

- **Testing & Debugging:** Start by running each module separately to ensure that Selenium interactions work as expected.  
- **Enhancements:** Integrate real API keys for 2Captcha and any SMS verification service you choose.  
- **Compliance:** Verify that the automation meets legal and ethical guidelines.

This design should give you a solid starting point. Feel free to ask for further clarification or assistance with specific parts of the code as you build and test your bot!
